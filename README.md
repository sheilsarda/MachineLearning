## Final Project: Optimal Portfolio Construction in Large Cap US Stocks using Machine Learning

The process of selecting a portfolio is composed of two stages: the first to analyze the historical data and build
an idea on the behavior of assets in the future, and the second one uses these insights to build the portfolio. Our project 
aims to use a supervised learning algorithm to forecast the direction of the stock and then create a portfolio by allocating
a percentage of funds to each stock.
