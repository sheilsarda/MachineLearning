These systems are researched heavily and provide high value to the company. One instance is that Netflix offered $1,000,000 prize for a team that improved the accuracy of their recommendation system by 10%, since this is a key part of their multi-billion dollar business.  Recommender Systems can be divided into three categories: Content-Filtering systems, Collaborative Filtering systems and Hybrid systems--a combination of the other two systems .\n","\n","**Content Filtering**  uses features of an item to recommend  similar items to users. It is used when a new user joins the platform as we don't know anything about the user's taste and behavioral pattern.\n","\n","**Collaborative Filtering** uses a user's past behaviour--its similarity with other others--to recommend similar products to the user. It works on the idea that people who have had similar behaviors in the past will behave similarly in the future, i.e if two users have liked similar items in the past then they would also agree we can recommend items from one of the user's list of purchased/viewed items to another user who hasn't.\n","\n","In this worksheet, we will recommend similar movies to the movies that the users have liked in the past based on the rating that the movie has garnered from different users."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Gb-cQuJJQen2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1604340623046,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":35150,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Ungar","photoUrl":"","userId":"12985737392773342244"}}},"source":["!pip install -U -q PyDrive\n","from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth\n","from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive\n","from google.colab import auth\n","from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials\n","# Authenticate and create the PyDrive client.\n","auth.authenticate_user()\n","gauth = GoogleAuth()\n","gauth.credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()\n","drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QNmFANaaBW6I","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1604340628511,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1389,"user":{"displayName":"Lyle Ungar","photoUrl":"","userId":"12985737392773342244"}}},"source":["downloaded = drive.CreateFile({'id':\"1h5fvp9dQcqPqh-VC_mWrZD5m26YIj03l\"})   # replace the id with id of file you want to access\n","downloaded.GetContentFile('movies.csv')   "],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bR-DQiGd8dG2"},"source":["## The Dataset\n","We will use the Movielens dataset, which contains a set of movies and the ratings given to these movies by different users.
